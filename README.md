In this project I have shown how a Fraud prevention system can be made. My database has some dummy fraud UPI ID's and whenever a new payment is made it checks from the database that UPI ID is reported or not, if the upi id is reported then it gives a pop up and stops.

Users can also report fraud UPI ID's, if it is the first time reported then that upi id will be added to frauds collection of the database and then as others will report it the count will keep increasing. 

There is also a Dashboard which shows all the reported fraud UPI iDs to the screen along with their count.
